# Usage

To use it yourself, fork it and host on github pages. You can find documentation for github pages [here](https://pages.github.com/)  

## Customization

I did not make this with easy customization in mind, but I did not try to make it hard to do either.  
You can edit the links, colours and image pretty easily, but changing the clock, layout and adding scripts will take more work on your end.  
I have no plans on making the webpage easier to vastly customize, I like keeping it as small and simple as I can.
